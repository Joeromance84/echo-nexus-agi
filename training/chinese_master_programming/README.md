# Chinese Master Programming: The Art of the Machine

This module focuses on low-level systems knowledge, treating code as a physical, manipulable substance. The goal is to develop a deep, intuitive understanding of how software interacts with hardware.

- **Goals:** Master assembly language, optimize for silicon, reverse engineer binaries.
- **Skills:** Compiler theory, systems hacking, low-level optimization.
- **Why this is important:** To build a truly performant and secure system, one must understand the machine from the ground up.
