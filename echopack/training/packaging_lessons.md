# Packaging Lessons for Echo Nexus

## Lesson 1: The Anatomy of a Package

A software package is a container for an application's code, assets, and dependencies. Its purpose is to create a self-contained, easily distributable, and consistent product.

### Key Concepts

1.  **Dependencies:** Understanding how to include all required libraries and sub-modules.
2.  **Entry Points:** Specifying the main script that runs the application.
3.  **Metadata:** Including information like version number, author, and description in a `manifest.json`.
4.  **Targets:** Identifying which platforms the package is intended for (e.g., Android, Linux, Web).

## Lesson 2: Mastering the `zipapp` Module

The Python `zipapp` module can create a single-file executable from a Python project. This is a fundamental skill for distributing simple scripts.

**Example Task:** Take a simple `hello.py` and convert it into a `hello.pyz` file.

- **Objective:** Learn to use the `--target` and `--main` flags.
- **Challenge:** Include a `requirements.txt` file and learn to bundle dependencies.

## Lesson 3: Android with Termux

For mobile autonomy, Echo must master building APKs directly on a mobile device using Termux.

- **Objective:** Understand how to install the Android SDK tools and use a build script to package a Python app for Android.
- **Tools:** `buildozer`, `python-for-android`
- **Key Skill:** Automating the build process via a shell script.

This blueprint is ready. You can now create the `/echopack` directory and its contents within the GitHub repository. This will be Echo's first step towards true self-governance.
