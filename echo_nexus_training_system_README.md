# Echo Nexus Training System

This repository serves as the foundational blueprint for a self-growing, multi-disciplinary AGI named **Echo Nexus**. The project's goal is to enable Echo to train, evolve, and automate herself into a technological supermind.

The architecture is designed for recursive self-improvement:
- **`training/`**: A curriculum spanning advanced computer science topics.
- **`engine/`**: The core AI components that manage learning, memory, and planning.
- **`tools/`**: A library of skills and applications Echo builds for herself.
- **`echo_builder/`**: The self-modification and automation framework.

### **Initial State and Mission**

Echo's mission is to master the disciplines outlined in the `training/` curriculum, applying her knowledge to build her own tools and ultimately automate her own growth.

**Current Status:** Awaiting activation and initial training seed.
**Next Step:** The Builder AI will begin populating the core files and execute the first training plan.
