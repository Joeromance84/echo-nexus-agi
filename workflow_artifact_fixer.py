## Issue Resolved: 
The workflow was failing with: "This request has been automatically failed because it uses a deprecated version of actions/upload-artifact: v3"

## Fix Applied:
Changed all instances of:
- `actions/upload-artifact@v3` 
- To: `actions/upload-artifact@v4`

## Expected Results:
- Workflows will now complete successfully
- APK artifacts will appear in downloadable Artifacts section
- No more deprecation warnings
