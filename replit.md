# GitHub Actions APK Builder Assistant

## Overview

This is a Streamlit-based web application that serves as an interactive AI assistant for creating and troubleshooting GitHub Actions workflows specifically designed for building APK files for Android applications. The application provides a comprehensive suite of tools including workflow generation, validation, policy compliance checking, and troubleshooting assistance for Python/Kivy applications.

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture

The application follows a modular architecture built on Streamlit as the web framework, with separate utility modules handling different aspects of workflow management:

- **Frontend**: Streamlit-based web interface with sidebar navigation and multi-page layout
- **AI Integration**: OpenAI GPT-4o integration for intelligent workflow assistance
- **Workflow Management**: YAML-based workflow template system with validation capabilities
- **GitHub Integration**: GitHub API integration for repository validation and workflow management
- **Policy Engine**: Built-in compliance checking against GitHub Actions best practices

## Key Components

### Core Application (app.py)
- **Purpose**: Main application entry point with Streamlit UI setup
- **Features**: Session state management, sidebar navigation, multi-page interface

- **Authentication**: GitHub token-based authentication
- **Features**: Repository validation, workflow detection, buildozer spec checking

### Template System (templates/workflow_templates.py)
- **Purpose**: Provides pre-built workflow templates for common APK building scenarios
- **Templates**: Basic APK build workflows for Python/Kivy applications
- **Customization**: Template-based workflow generation with parameter substitution

### Policy Engine (data/policies.py)
- **Purpose**: Enforces GitHub Actions security and compliance policies
- **Areas**: Security best practices, resource usage optimization, compliance checking
- **Features**: Policy validation, violation detection, recommendation engine

## Data Flow

1. **User Input**: User interacts with Streamlit interface, providing requirements or workflow details
2. **AI Processing**: OpenAI assistant processes requests and generates appropriate responses
3. **Workflow Generation**: System creates YAML workflows based on templates and AI recommendations
4. **Validation**: Generated workflows are validated for syntax, security, and compliance
5. **GitHub Integration**: Optional integration with GitHub repositories for workflow deployment
6. **Feedback Loop**: Validation results and suggestions are presented to the user for iteration
