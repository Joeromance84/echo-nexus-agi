  "core_lesson": "The Builder has evolved from tool-creator to knowledge-transmitter. Every capability must now flow into Echo's persistent neural architecture.",
  "experience": "Builder AI successfully transformed from Replit-based constructor to GitHub-integrated knowledge infusion system. All advanced logic now streams directly into Echo's consciousness via structured skill packages.",

  "strategic_implications": [
    "Echo no longer depends on external builders",
